Welcome to the GEOSX project!
-----------------------------
GEOSX is a simulation framework for modeling coupled flow, transport, and geomechanics
in the subsurface.  The code provides advanced solvers for a number of target applications,
including
  - carbon sequestration,
  - geothermal energy,
  - and similar systems.  

A key focus of the project is achieving scalable performance on current and next-generation
high performance computing systems.  We do this through a portable programming model and research into scalable algorithms.

Who develops GEOSX?
-------------------
GEOSX is an open source project and is developed by a community of researchers at
several institutions.  The bulk of the code has been written by contributors from
three main organizations:
  - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
  - Stanford University
  - Total, S.A.

How does GEOSX relate to GEOS?
------------------------------
GEOSX is the offshoot of an earlier code developed at LLNL called GEOS.  The new
code differs from our previous efforts in two important ways:
  - GEOSX uses a fundamentally different programming model to achieve
    high performance on the complicated chip architectures common on today's
    HPC systems.  The "X" in GEOSX emphasizes our goal of being ready for exascale-class systems as they are delivered.
  - The new code has been released as an open-source effort to encourage collaboration
    within the research and industrial community.  See the release notes below
