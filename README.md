Welcome to the GEOS project!
-----------------------------
GEOS is a simulation framework for modeling coupled flow, transport, and geomechanics
in the subsurface.  The code provides advanced solvers for a number of target applications,
including
  - carbon sequestration,
  - geothermal energy,
  - and similar systems.  

A key focus of the project is achieving scalable performance on current and next-generation
high performance computing systems.  We do this through a portable programming model and research into scalable algorithms.

and applied engineering components of this effort.

Documentation

Who develops GEOS?
-------------------
GEOS is an open source project and is developed by a community of researchers at
several institutions.  The bulk of the code has been written by contributors from
four main organizations:
  - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
  - Stanford University,
  - TotalEnergies,
  - Chevron

See our
[authors](https://geosx-geosx.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/docs/sphinx/Contributors.html)

page for more details.  

How does GEOS relate to the earlier GEOS code?
------------------------------
GEOS is the offshoot of an earlier code developed at LLNL also called GEOS.  The new
code differs from our previous efforts in two important ways:
  - This new code GEOS uses a fundamentally different programming model to achieve
    high performance on the complicated chip architectures common on today's
    HPC systems.  This code is ready for exascale-class systems as they are delivered.
  - The new code has been released as an open-source effort to encourage collaboration
    within the research and industrial community.  See the release notes below
    for details of the [LGPL 2.1 License](./LICENSE) that has been adopted.
