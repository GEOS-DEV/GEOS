This PR addresses:
1) a bug in the implicit mechanics solver functionality. The trilinosIndex has been changed from an integer_array to a localIndex_array and this was not consistent everywhere resulting in failed lookups. 

2) a bug in the integer_conversion function. Previously conversion between signed and unsigned types failed when trying to ensure that no truncation occured. This has been addressed by implementing separate functions to handle the signed->unsigned and the unsigned->signed cases.

This pull request replaced the legacy array types with the ManagedArray type. This is the first step in the use of CHAI. The next step is the have the GEOS::managedArray type wrap a CHAI::managedArray type.

This pull request replaces int32, int64, uint32 and uint64 as part of the interface for geos. The aliases for int32 and int64 are still defined in DataTypes.hpp, but are not part of the interface. They are replaced by integer, localIndex, globalIndex. These types are actually aliases for one of the fundamental integer types.Also, unsigned ints are not to be used in GEOS. This allows use of -1 as an invalid localIndex and globalIndex.

v0.0.14

This PR is intended to add better structure to the main mesh data objects. Specifically, the concept of a MeshBody is introduced, which contains MeshLevel objects to represent each level of mesh refinement.

Also modified some build config to generate a GeosxConfig.hpp file that contains preprocessor variable rather than inputing from the compilation line. this allows IDE's to recognize the variables, and allows for easier troubleshooting later on.

this pr separates tpl's from the main build. They are now built manually prior to the main build, albeit using the same cmake build procedure as the main build. The config-build.py script option -tpl has been added to indicate setup of the tpl build.

implement a mapped vector to hold subgroups and views. objects are stored in a vector, but there is a hash lookup in a map. also implement a smart key that contains a string and an int. it uses the int to perform the lookup, and verifies the key is correct. If key is incorrect performs the map lookup and resets the int value.
