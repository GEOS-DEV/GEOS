Notes
==========

This file is designed to track changes to the integrated test baselines.
Any developer who updates the baseline ID in the .integrated_tests.yaml file is expected to create an entry in this file with the pull request number, date, and their justification for rebaselining.
These notes should be in reverse-chronological order, and use the following time format: (YYYY-MM-DD).
