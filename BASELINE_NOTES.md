Notes
==========

This file is designed to track changes to the integrated test baselines.
Any developer who updates the baseline ID in the .integrated_tests.yaml file is expected to create an entry in this file with the pull request number, date, and their justification for rebaselining.
These notes should be in reverse-chronological order, and use the following time format: (YYYY-MM-DD).

PR #3138 (2024-06-11)
======================
Properly sync nonlinear solver params for coupled solver. Baseline update mostly due to number of iterations change in baseline files.


PR #3140 (2024-06-11)
======================
Fixed derivative in EzrokhiBrineDensity


PR #3080 (2024-06-07)
=====================
Rebaseline after adding viscoelastic wave propagator.


PR #3075 (2024-06-05)
=====================
Introduce configuration tolerance. Rebaseline because of the new parameter in NonlinearSolverParameters.


PR #3120 (2024-06-05)
=====================
Add missing compositionalMultiphaseFlow tests into ATS and adjust output naming. Rebaseline accordingly.


PR #3113 (2024-06-05)
=====================
Add general version updateConfiguration. Rebaseline of some edfm cases is needed.

PR #3050 (2024-05-20)
=====================
Spatially varying grain bulk modulus. Rebaseline of all poromechanics cases needed.


PR #3141 (2024-05-28)
=====================
Test cashing baselines locally.


PR #3125 (2024-05-16)
=====================
Remove field to store pressure gradient cell-wise for solvers that don't need it.


PR #2110 (2024-05-13)
=====================
new field to store pressure gradient cell-wise.


PR #3060 (2024-05-13)
======================
Rebaselined after addition of elastic VTI wave propagator. 


PR #4950 (2024-05-10)
======================
