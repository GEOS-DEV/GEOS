GEOSX Documentation
=================================

Welcome to our documentation pages!

GEOSX is a code framework focused on enabling streamlined development of
physics simulations on high performance computing platforms.  Our documentation
is organized into several separate guides, given that different users will have
different needs.

We recommend all users begin with the Quick Start guide, which
will walk you through downloading and compiling the code.  Application focused
users may then want to explore our Tutorials, which provide an introduction to the
basic capabilities of the code.  More detailed descriptions of these capabilities can
then be found in the User Guide.

For those interested in developing new capabilities in GEOSX, we provide a Developer Guide.
The code itself is also documented inline using doyxgen.  The Build Guide
contains more detailed information about third-party dependencies, the build
system, and the continuous integration system.  Finally, GEOSX has a self-documenting
data structure.  The Datastructure Index is an automatically generated list of
all available input parameters and data structures in the code.  This is a
comprehensive resource, but probably not the place to start.

High quality documentation is a critical component of a successful code.  If
you have suggestions for improving the guides below, please post an issue on our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/GEOSX/GEOSX/issues>`_.
