####################################################
Elasto-Plastic Near-Well Deformation
####################################################


**Context**

The main goal of this example is to learn how to use the internal wellbore mesh generator and an elasto-plastic model to handle wellbore problems in GEOSX. The Extended Drucker-Prager model (see :ref:`DruckerPragerExtended`) is applied to solve for elastoplastic deformation within the vicinity of a vertical wellbore. For the presented example, an analytical solution is employed to verify the accuracy of the numerical results. The resulting model can be used as a base for more complex analysis (e.g., wellbore drilling, fluid injection and storage scenarios). 


**Objectives**

At the end of this example you will know:

  - how to construct meshes for wellbore problems with the internal mesh generator,
  - how to specify initial and boundary conditions, such as in-situ stresses and variation of traction at the wellbore wall,
  - how to use a plastic model for mechanical problems in the near wellbore region.

Description of the case
------------------------------------------------------------------

We simulate a drained wellbore problem subjected to isotropic horizontal stress (:math:`\sigma_h`) and vertical stress (:math:`\sigma_v`). By lowering the wellbore supporting pressure (:math:`P_w`), the wellbore contracts, and the reservoir rock experiences elastoplastic deformation. A plastic zone develops in the near wellbore region, as shown below.

To simulate this phenomenon, the strain hardening Extended Drucker-Prager model with an associated plastic flow rule in GEOSX is used in this example. Displacement and stress fields around the wellbore are numerically calculated. These numerical predictions are then compared with the corresponding analytical solutions `(Chen and Abousleiman, 2017)  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1365160917301090>`__ from the literature. 



All inputs for this case are contained inside a single XML file.
In this example, we focus our attention on the ``Mesh`` tags,
the ``Constitutive`` tags, and the ``FieldSpecifications`` tags.

   Generated mesh for the wellbore problem


Let us take a closer look at the geometry of this wellbore problem.
We use the internal mesh generator ``InternalWellbore`` to create a rock domain
(:math:`10\, m \, \times 5 \,  m \, \times 2 \, m`), with a wellbore of
initial radius equal to :math:`0.1` m.
Coordinates of ``trajectory`` defines the wellbore trajectory, which represents a vertical well in this example. 
By turning on ``autoSpaceRadialElems="{ 1 }"``, the internal mesh generator automatically sets number and spacing of elements in the radial direction, which overrides the values of ``nr``. 
With ``useCartesianOuterBoundary="0"``, a Cartesian aligned outer boundary on the outer block is enforced.
In this way, a structured three-dimensional mesh is created with 100 x 80 x 2 elements in the radial, tangential and z directions, respectively. All the elements are eight-node hexahedral elements (``C3D8``) and refinement is performed
to conform with the wellbore geometry. This mesh is defined as a cell block with the name
``cb1``.

------------------------
Solid mechanics solver
------------------------

For the drained wellbore problem, the pore pressure variation is omitted and can be subtracted from the analysis. Therefore, we just need to define a solid mechanics solver, which is called ``mechanicsSolver``. 
This solid mechanics solver (see :ref:`SolidMechanicsLagrangianFEM`) is based on the Lagrangian finite element formulation. 
The problem is run as ``QuasiStatic`` without considering inertial effects. 
The computational domain is discretized by ``FE1``, which is defined in the ``NumericalMethods`` section. 
The material is named as ``rock``, whose mechanical properties are specified in the ``Constitutive`` section.

  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_SOLVER_END -->

------------------------------
Constitutive laws
------------------------------

For this drained wellbore problem, we simulate the elastoplastic deformation caused by wellbore contraction.
A homogeneous domain with one solid material is assumed, whose mechanical properties are specified in the ``Constitutive`` section: 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../inputFiles/solidMechanics/ExtendedDruckerPragerWellbore_base.xml
    :language: xml
    :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_MATERIAL -->
    :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_MATERIAL_END -->


Recall that in the ``SolidMechanics_LagrangianFEM`` section, 
``rock`` is designated as the material in the computational domain. 
Here, Extended Drucker Prager model ``ExtendedDruckerPrager`` is used to simulate the elastoplastic behavior of ``rock``.
As for the material parameters, ``defaultInitialFrictionAngle``, ``defaultResidualFrictionAngle`` and ``defaultCohesion`` denote the initial friction angle, the residual friction angle, and cohesion, respectively, as defined by the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope.
As the residual friction angle ``defaultResidualFrictionAngle`` is larger than the initial one ``defaultInitialFrictionAngle``, a  strain hardening model is adopted, whose hardening rate is given as ``defaultHardening="0.01"``. 
If the residual friction angle is set to be less than the initial one, strain weakening will take place. 
Setting ``defaultDilationRatio="1.0"`` corresponds to an associated flow rule.
The constitutive parameters such as the density, the bulk modulus, and the shear modulus are specified in the International System of Units.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Initial and boundary conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to specify fields, including:

  - The initial value (the in-situ stresses and traction at the wellbore wall have to be initialized)
  - The boundary conditions (the reduction of wellbore pressure and constraints of the outer boundaries have to be set)

In this example, we need to specify isotropic horizontal stress (:math:`\sigma_h` = -11.25 MPa) and vertical stress (:math:`\sigma_v` = -15.0 MPa). 
To reach equilibrium, a compressive traction :math:`P_w` = -11.25 MPa is instantaneously applied at the wellbore wall ``rneg`` at time :math:`t` = 0 s, which will then be gradually reduced to a lower value (-2.0 MPa) to let wellbore contract.
The remaining parts of the outer boundaries are subjected to roller constraints.  
These boundary conditions are set up through the ``FieldSpecifications`` section.


.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../inputFiles/solidMechanics/ExtendedDruckerPragerWellbore_base.xml
    :language: xml
    :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_BC -->
    :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_BC_END -->


With ``tractionType="normal"``, traction is applied to the wellbore wall ``rneg`` as a pressure specified from the product of scale ``scale="-11.25e6"`` and the outward face normal. 
A table function ``timeFunction`` is used to define the time-dependent traction ``ExternalLoad``. 
The ``coordinates`` and ``values`` form a time-magnitude
pair for the loading time history. In this case, the loading magnitude decreases linearly as the time evolves. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../inputFiles/solidMechanics/ExtendedDruckerPragerWellbore_base.xml
    :language: xml
    :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_TABLE -->
    :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_DP_WELLBORE_TABLE_END -->

You may note :

 - All initial value fields must have ``initialCondition`` field set to ``1``;
 - The ``setName`` field points to the previously defined box to apply the fields;
 - ``nodeManager`` and ``faceManager`` in the ``objectPath`` indicate that the boundary conditions are applied to the element nodes and faces, respectively;
 - ``fieldName`` is the name of the field registered in GEOSX;
 - Component ``0``, ``1``, and ``2`` refer to the x, y, and z direction, respectively;
 - And the non-zero values given by ``Scale`` indicate the magnitude of the loading; 
 - Some shorthand, such as ``xneg`` and ``xpos``, are used as the locations where the boundary conditions are applied in the computational domain. For instance, ``xneg`` means the portion of the computational domain located at the left-most in the x-axis, while ``xpos`` refers to the portion located at the right-most area in the x-axis. Similar shorthand include ``ypos``, ``yneg``, ``zpos``, and ``zneg``;
 - The mud pressure loading has a negative value due to the negative sign convention for compressive stress in GEOSX.

Inspecting results
---------------------------------

In the above example, we requested silo-format output files. We can therefore import these into VisIt and use python scripts to visualize the outcome. Below figure shows the comparisons between the numerical predictions (marks) and the corresponding analytical solutions (solid curves) with respect to the distributions of normal stress components, stress path, the supporting wellbore pressure and wellbore size. It is clear that the GEOSX predictions are in excellent agreement with the analytical results.

   Comparing GEOSX results with analytical solutions


For the same wellbore problem, using different constitutive models (plastic vs. elastic), obviously, distinct differences in rock deformation and distribution of resultant stresses is also observed and highlighted.
