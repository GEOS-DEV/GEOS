Deviated Poro-Elastic Wellbore Subjected to In-situ Stresses and Pore Pressure

Problem description
------------------------------------------------------------------


This example deals with the problem of drilling a deviated poro-elastic wellbore. This is an extension of the poroelastic wellbore example :ref:`AdvancedExampleDeviatedPoroElasticWellbore` with the consideration of in-situ stresses and in-situ pore pressure. Both pore pressure and mud pressure are supposed to be nil at the borehole wall following the consideration of `(Abousleiman and Cui, 1998) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768398001012>`__. Also, the in-situ horizontal stresses are anisotropic, i.e. :math:`\sigma_hmax` > :math:`\sigma_hmin`. The wellbore trajectory is deviated from the directions of the in-situ stresses. Analytical solutions of the pore pressure, the radial and hoop stresses in the near wellbore region are given by `(Abousleiman and Cui, 1998) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768398001012>`__. They are hereby used to verify the modeling predictions.

**Input file**

Everything required is
contained within two GEOS xml files that are located at:

.. code-block:: console

  inputFiles/wellbore/DeviatedPoroElasticWellbore_Drilling_base.xml


.. code-block:: console

  inputFiles/wellbore/DeviatedPoroElasticWellbore_Drilling_benchmark.xml


This case is nearly identical to another example :ref:`AdvancedExampleDeviatedPoroElasticWellbore`, except for the ``FieldSpecifications`` tag. For this specific case, we need to consider following additional field specifications to define the in-situ stresses, in-situ pore pressure, as well as the zero pore pressure at the borehole wall.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../../inputFiles/wellbore/DeviatedPoroElasticWellbore_Drilling_base.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_InsituConditions -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_InsituConditionsEnd -->

Results and benchmark

Pore pressure distribution after 78 s injection is shown in the figure below:

A good agreement between the GEOS results and the corresponding analytical solutions `(Abousleiman and Cui, 1998) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768398001012>`__ is shown in the figure below:
