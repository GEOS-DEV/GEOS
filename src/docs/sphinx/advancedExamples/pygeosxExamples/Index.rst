pygeosx Examples
=================================

The :ref:`pygeosxInterface` enables users to query and/or manipulate the GEOS datastructure with python in real-time.
The following examples show how to use `pygeosx` interface and the supplemental `pygeosx_tools_package`.

A quick warning: these examples are recommended for advanced users only.
The pygeosx interface requires users to be familiar with the GEOS datastructure, and can trigger the code to crash if an object/variable is inappropriately modified.
