After this tutorial, you will know:
- how to do this (feature A),
- how to do that (feature B),
- how to use this functionality with this specific feature (feature C).

For this we will use a generic test case based on the XXXX field/based on a synthetic field.


General description of the case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Context, images, specific technical details relevant to achieve the goal
Also give a summary of what the results should look like.



Preparing the input files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inspecting the input
---------------------------------

List here all required input files: grids, XML, external dependencies


How to do this (feature A)
---------------------------------



How to do this (feature B)
---------------------------------



How to use this feature with this specific feature (feature C)
---------------------------------




Running the case and inspecting the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Running the case
---------------------------------

Run the case using the following command:

When it is finished, if successful, you should see this:


Inspecting results
---------------------------------

Plot this, look at that. Check this metric.


Sensitivity analysis
---------------------------------

We are going to explore how this parameters impact this result.
- first analysis: changing this parameter,
- second analysis: looking at the impact on this output of this parameter.
- third analysis:


To go further
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to know more, you can inspect the code where these features are implemented: Dev guide examples.

Paper and theoretical references relevant to feature A are here: xx, feature B are here.

The tutorial examples should run as-is.
If you find any issues running these cases, please ensure that your installation is sound by running unit and integrated test (link to a page that explains how to do this).
If it still does not work as expected, please submit an issue here.
