Tutorial 3: A simple field case
#########################################

**Context**

In this tutorial, we set up a simple field case for single-phase flow simulation (see :ref:`SinglePhaseFlow`). We demonstrate how to run a basic flow simulation in the reservoir layer. We do not consider any coupling with wells. Injection and production will be specified by imposing a high pressure in the cells close to the injection area and a low pressure in the cells close to the production area.

**Objectives**

At the end of this tutorial you will know:

  - how to import external mesh information and properties,
  - how to run a specific solver (here, flow) in a specific region only,
  - the basic method of using boxes to set up boundary conditions,
  - how to use *TableFunction* to import fields varying in time and/or space,
  - how to control output frequency and export results for visualization.


**Input file**

The xml input file for this test case is located at:

.. code-block:: console

  src/coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml

We consider the following mesh as a numerical support to the simulations in this tutorial:

.. image:: mesh.png
   :width: 600px

This mesh contains three continuous regions:

  - a Top region (overburden, elementary tag = `Overburden`)
  - a Middle region (reservoir layer, elementary tag = `Reservoir`)
  - a Bottom region (underburden, elementary tag = `Underburden`)

The mesh is defined using the GMSH file format (see :ref:`Meshes` for more information on
the supported mesh file format). Each tetrahedron is associated to a unique tag.

------------------------------------
GEOSX input files
------------------------------------

The XML file considered here follows the typical structure of the GEOSX input files:

 #. :ref:`Solver <Solver_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Mesh <Mesh_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Geometry <Geometry_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Events <Events_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`NumericalMethods <NumericalMethods_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`ElementRegions <ElementRegions_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Constitutive <Constitutive_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`FieldSpecifications <FieldSpecifications_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Outputs <Outputs_tag_field_case>`
 #. :ref:`Functions <Functions_tag_field_case>`


.. _Solver_tag_field_case:

Defining a solver
-----------------

Let us inspect the **Solver** XML tags.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_SOLVER -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_SOLVER_END -->


This node gathers all the information previously defined.
We use a classical ``SinglePhaseFVM`` Finite Volume Method,
with the two-point flux approximation
as will be defined in the **NumericalMethod** tag.
The ``targetRegions`` refers only
to the Reservoir region because we only solve for flow in this region.
The ``fluidNames`` and ``solidNames`` refer the materials defined
in the **Constitutive** tag.

The ``NonlinearSolverParameters`` and ``LinearSolverParameters`` are used to set usual
numerical solver parameters such as the linear and nonlinear tolerances, the preconditioner and solver types or the maximum number of nonlinear iterations.


.. _Mesh_tag_field_case:

Specifying a computational mesh
----------------------------------

Here, we use the ``PAMELAMeshGenerator`` to load the mesh (see :ref:`ImportingExternalMesh`).
The syntax to import external meshes is simple : in the XML file,
the mesh ``file`` is included with its relative or absolute path to the location of the geosx XML file and a user-specified ``name`` label for the mesh object.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_MESH -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_MESH_END -->


.. _Geometry_tag_field_case:

Geometry tag
-----------------

        Here, we are using definition of ``source`` and ``sink`` boxes in addition to the ``all`` box in order to flag sets of nodes or cells which will act as injection or production.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY_END -->

In order to define a box, the user defines ``xMax`` and ``xMin``, two diagonally opposite nodes of the box.

.. _Events_tag_field_case:

Specifying events
------------------------

The events are used here to guide the simulation through time,
and specify when outputs must be triggered.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_EVENTS -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_EVENTS_END -->

The **Events** tag is associated with the ``maxTime`` keyword defining the maximum time.
If this time is ever reached or exceeded, the simulation ends.

Two ``PeriodicEvent`` are defined.
- The first one, ``solverApplications``, is associated with the solver. The  ``forceDt`` keyword means that there will always be time-steps of 23 days (2 000 000 seconds).
- The second, ``outputs``, is associated with the output. The ``timeFrequency`` keyword means that it will be executed every 116 days (10 000 000 seconds). The ``targetExactTimestep`` is set to 1, meaning that the Event Manager will impose this event will be triggered exactly every 116 days, constraining schedule decided by application to match this date.


.. _NumericalMethods_tag_field_case:

Defining Numerical Methods
----------------------------------

Defining the numerical method used in the solver, we will provide information on how to discretize our equations. Here a classical two-point flux approximation (TPFA) scheme is used to discretize water fluxes over faces.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_NUMERICAL -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_NUMERICAL_END -->

The ``TwoPointFluxApproximation`` node should specify
the primary field to solve for as ``fieldName``.
For a flow problem, this field is the pressure.
Here we specified ``targetRegions`` as we only solve flow for reservoir.
The field under ``coefficientName`` is used during TPFA transmissibilities construction.

.. _ElementRegions_tag_field_case:

Defining regions in the mesh
-----------------------------------

Assuming that the overburden and the underburden are impermeable,
and flow only takes place in the reservoir, we need to define regions.

There are two methods to achieve this regional solve.

- The first solution is to define a unique ``CellElementRegion`` corresponding to the reservoir.

        .. code-block:: xml

                <ElementRegion>
                <CellElementRegion name="ReservoirLayer"
                                   cellBlocks="{Reservoir_TETRA}"
                                   materialList="{water, rock}">
                </ElementRegion>

- The second solution is to define all the ``CellElementRegions`` as they are in the GMSH file, but defining the solvers only on the reservoir layer. In this case, the **ElementRegion** tag is :

        .. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
                :language: xml
                :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_REGION -->
                :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_REGION_END -->

We opt for the latest as it allows to visualize over- and underburdens and to change regions handling in ther tag without needing to amend the **ElementRegion** tag.

.. note::
  The material list here was set for a single-phase flow problem. This list is subject
  to change if the problem is not a single-phase flow problem.

.. _Constitutive_tag_field_case:

Defining material properties with constitutive laws
-------------------------------------------------------

We simulate a single-phase flow in the reservoir layer, hence with two types of materials, a fluid (water) and solid (rock).

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_CONSTITUTIVE -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_CONSTITUTIVE_END -->

The constitutive parameters such as the density, the viscosity, and the compressibility are specified in the International System of Units.

.. note::
  To consider an incompressible fluid, the user has to set the compressibility to 0.

.. _FieldSpecifications_tag_field_case:

Defining properties with the FieldSpecifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to specify fields, including:

  - The initial value (here, the pressure has to be initialized)
  - The static properties (here, we have to define the permeability tensor and the porosity)
  - The boundary conditions (here, the injection and production pressure have to be set)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_FIELD -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_FIELD_END -->

You may note :

 - All static parameters and initial value fields must have ``initialCondition`` field set to ``1``.
 - The ``objectPath`` refers to the ``ElementRegion`` in which the field has its value,
 - The ``setName`` field points to the box previously defined to apply the fields,
 - ``name`` and ``fieldName`` have a different meaning: ``name`` is used to give a name to the XML block. This ``name`` must be unique. ``fieldName`` is the name of the field registered in GEOSX. This value has to be set according to the expected input fields of each solver.

.. note::
  GEOSX handles permeability as a diagonal matrix, so the three values of the permeability tensor are set individually using the ``component`` field,

.. _Outputs_tag_field_case:

Specifying the output formats
----------------------------------

The **Outputs** XML tag is used to trigger the writing of visualization files.
Here, we write files in a format natively readable by Paraview under the tar *VTK*

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_OUTPUT -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_OUTPUT_END -->

.. note::
  The ``name`` keyword defines the name of the output directory.

.. _Functions_tag_field_case:

------------------------------------------------
Using Functions to specify dependent properties
------------------------------------------------

Eventually, one can define varying properties using ``TableFunction`` (:ref:`FunctionManager`) under the **Functions** tag:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_TFUNC -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_TFUNC_END -->

Here, the injection pressure is set to vary with time. Attentive reader might have
noticed that ``sourceTerm`` was bound to a ``TableFunction`` named *timeInj* under
**FieldSpecifications** tag definition. The initial pressure is set based on the values
contained in the table formed by the files which are specified. In particular,
the files *xlin.geos*, *ylin.geos* and *zlin.geos* define a regular meshing of
the bounding box containing the reservoir. The *pressure.geos* file then defines the values of the pressure at those points.

We proceed in a similar manner as for *pressure.geos* to map a heterogeneous permeability field (here the 5th layer of the SPE 10 test case) onto our unstructured grid. This mapping will use a nearest point interpolation rule.

.. image:: mapping_perm.png
   :width: 600px

.. note::
  The varying values imposed in *values* or passed through *voxelFile* are premultiplied by the *scale* attribute from **FieldSpecifications**.

------------------------------------
Running GEOSX
------------------------------------

The simulation can be launched with:

.. code-block:: console

  geosx -i FieldCaseTutorial1.xml

One can notice the correct load of the field function among the starting output messages

.. code-block:: console

------------------------------------
Visualization of results
------------------------------------

We can open the file `syntheticReservoirVizFile.pvd` with Paraview to visualize the simulation
results. The initial pressure field in the reservoir region is provided below as an example.

.. image:: pressureField_initial.png
   :width: 600px

Since, in the event block, we have asked for the output to be generated at regular
intervals throughout the simulation, we can also visualize the pressure
distribution at different simulation times, showing the variation in the injection control.
