=================================

The easiest way to learn to use GEOSX is through a few worked examples.
Here, we have included tutorials showing how to use GEOSX on common problems.
After working through these examples, you will have a good understanding
of how to set up and solve a simulation problem.

Next, we invite you to look at the User Guide.
The user guide provides a comprehensive description of all options
available in the code and background theory for key methods.

Finally, for those interested in developing within GEOSX
the Developer Guide gives information on the code structure
and how to extend its functionalities.
