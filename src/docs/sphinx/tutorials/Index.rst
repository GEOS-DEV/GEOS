Tutorials
=================================

The easiest way to learn to use GEOSX is through a few worked examples.
Here, we have included several tutorials showing how to solve some simple but common problems.
After working through these examples, you should have a good feel for the overall
structure of the code and the important components that go into defining a simulation.

These tutorials are meant as a supplement to the User Guide, not a replacement. 
The guide provides a comprehensive description of all options
available within the code, as well as background theory for key methods.  

We suggest new users begin with the tutorials, and then start exploring sections of 
the User Guide most relevant to their needs.  Those interested in developing within
the GEOSX framework should also read the Developer Guide.
