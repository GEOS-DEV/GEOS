Tutorials
=================================

The easiest way to learn to use GEOSX is through worked examples.
Here, we have included tutorials showing how to run some common problems.
After working through these examples, you should have a good understanding of how to set up and solve your own models.

Note that these tutorials are intended to be followed in sequence, as each step introduces a few new skills.
Most of the tutorial models are also quite small, so that large computational resources are not required.
