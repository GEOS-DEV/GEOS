Tutorial 5: Multiphase flow in the Egg model  
########################################################

**Context**

In this tutorial, we illustrate the concepts presented in :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`
using the three-dimensional `Egg model <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gdj3.21>`_.
We show how to set up a water injection problem relying on a Dead-Oil thermodynamic model.
The twelve wells (four producers and eight injectors) are placed according to the description
of the original test case.

**Objectives**

In this tutorial, we re-use many GEOSX features already presented in
:ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`, with a focus on:

- how to import an external mesh with embedded geological properties (permeability) in the GMSH format (``.msh``),
- how to choose constitutive parameters matching those of the original test case, 
- how to tune the time stepping strategy and the nonlinear solver parameters.
  
**Input file**

This tutorial is based on the XML file located at

.. code-block:: console

  src/coreComponents/physicsSolvers/fluidFlow/benchmarks/Egg/dead_oil_egg.xml

The mesh file corresponding to the Egg model is stored in the GEOSXDATA repository.
Therefore, you must first download the GEOSXDATA repository in the same folder
as the GEOSX repository to run this test case.

.. note::
        GEOSXDATA is a separate repository in which we store large mesh files in order to keep the main GEOSX repository lightweight.
   
------------------------------------
GEOSX input file

The XML file considered here follows the typical structure of the GEOSX input files:

.. _Solver_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Solvers
-------

In this tutorial, we use the approach described in :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`
to couple reservoir flow with wells.
That is, we define a *coupling solver* of type **CompositionalMultiphaseReservoir**
named ``coupledFlowAndWells``. 
This coupling solver drives the simulation and is in charge of binding the following
single-physics solvers:

- the single-physics reservoir flow solver, a solver of type **CompositionalMultiphaseFlow** named ``compositionalMultiphaseFlow`` and documented at :ref:`CompositionalMultiphaseFlow`,
- the single-physics well solver, a solver of type **CompositionalMultiphaseWell** named ``compositionalMultiphaseWell`` and documented at :ref:`CompositionalMultiphaseWell`.

The **Solvers** XML block is shown below.
The coupling solver points to the two single-physics solvers using the attributes
``flowSolverName`` and ``wellSolverName``.
We use the same names as in :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10` for simplicity, but
these names can be chosen by the user and are not imposed by GEOSX.
The flow solver is applied to the reservoir and the well solver is applied to the wells,
as specified by their respective ``targetRegions`` attributes.
  
The solver information is specified in the **NonlinearSolverParameters** and
**LinearSolverParameters** XML blocks.
These blocks should be nested in the **CompositionalMultiphaseReservoir** XML block since
the coupling solver drives the solution strategy.
Note that any solver information specified in the single-physics XML blocks will
not be taken into account.

Here, we instruct GEOSX to perform at least ``newtonMinIter = 1`` Newton iterations and
at most ``newtonMaxIter = 10``. GEOSX will adjust the time step size as follows:

- if the Newton solver converges in ``dtIncIterLimit x newtonMaxIter = 5`` iterations or fewer, GEOSX will double the time step size for the next time step,
- if the Newton solver converges in ``dtCutIterLimit x newtonMaxIter = 8`` iterations or more, GEOSX will reduce the time step size for the next time step by a factor ``timestepCutFactor = 0.1``,
- if the Newton solver fails to converge in ``newtonMaxIter = 10``, GEOSX will cut the time step size by a factor ``timestepCutFactor = 0.1`` and restart from the previous converged time step.

The maximum number of time step cuts is specified by the attribute ``maxTimeStepCuts``.
Note that a backtracking line search can be activated by setting the attribute ``lineSearchAction`` to 1 or 2.
If ``lineSearchAction = 1``, we accept the nonlinear iteration even if the line search does not reduce the residual norm.
If ``lineSearchAction = 1``, we cut the time step if the line search does not reduce the residual norm.

.. _Mesh_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Specifying a reservoir mesh and defining the geometry of the wells
------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Mesh** block consists of two parts:

- The reservoir mesh is described in the **PAMELAMeshGenerator** block,
- The wells are described in the **InternalWell** blocks, with one well per block.

The reservoir mesh is imported from a ``.msh`` file that contains the mesh geometry
and also includes the permeability values in the x, y, and z directions.
These quantities must be specified using the metric unit system, i.e., in meters
for the well geometry and square meters for the permeability field.
We note that the mesh file only contains the active cells, so there is no keyword
needed in the XML file  to define them.

As in :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`, the geometry of the twelve wells is defined
internally using the description provided in the **InternalWell** XML blocks.
We remind the user that each block **InternalWell** must point to the reservoir mesh
(using the attribute ``meshName``), the corresponding well region (using
the attribute ``wellRegionName``), and the corresponding well control
(using the attribute ``wellControlName``).
Each well is defined using a vertical polyline going through the seven layers of the
mesh, with a perforation in each layer.
The well transmissibility factors employed to compute the perforation rates are calculated
internally using the Peaceman formulation.
The well placement implemented here follows the pattern of the original test case.

  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_MESH_END -->


.. _Geometry_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Geometry tag
-----------------

The **Geometry** XML block was used in the single-phase tutorials to specify boundary conditions.
Since we use wells and assume no-flow boundary conditions in this tutorial, the **Geometry**
block is not needed.

.. _Events_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Specifying events
------------------------

In the **Events** XML block, we specify four types of **PeriodicEvents**.

The periodic event named ``solverApplications`` notifies GEOSX that the
coupled solver ``coupledFlowAndWells`` has to be applied to its target
regions (here, reservoir and wells) at every time step.
The time stepping strategy has been fully defined in the **CompositionalMultiphaseReservoir**
coupling block using the ``initialDt`` attribute and the **NonlinearSolverParameters**
nested block.

As in :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`, we also define an output event
instructing GEOSX to write out ``.vtk`` files at the time frequency specified
by the attribute ``timeFrequency``.
The ``target`` attribute must point to the **VTK** sub-block of the **Outputs**
block (defined at the end of the XML file) by name (here, ``vtkOutput``).

We define the events involved in the collection and output of the well production rates following the procedure defined in :ref:`TasksManager`.
The time history collection events trigger the collection of the well rates at the desired frequency, while the time history output events trigger the output of the HDF5 files containing the time series.
These events point by name to the corresponding blocks of the **Tasks** and **Outputs** XML blocks, respectively. Here, these names are ``wellRateCollection1`` and ``timeHistoryOutput1``.

  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_EVENTS_END -->


.. _NumericalMethods_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Defining Numerical Methods
----------------------------------

In the ``NumericalMethods`` XML block, we instruct GEOSX to use a TPFA finite-volume
numerical scheme.
This part is identical to the corresponding section of :ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/fluidFlow/benchmarks/Egg/dead_oil_egg.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_NUMERICAL_METHODS -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_NUMERICAL_METHODS_END -->


.. _ElementRegions_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Defining reservoir and well regions
-----------------------------------

In this section of the input file, we follow the procedure already described in
:ref:`TutorialDeadOilBottomLayersSPE10` for the definition of the reservoir and well
regions.

We associate a **CellElementRegion** named ``reservoir`` to the reservoir mesh.
Since we have imported a mesh with one region consisting of hexahedral cells, we
must set the attribute ``cellBlocks`` to ``DEFAULT_HEX``.

.. note::
        If you use a name that is not ``DEFAULT_HEX`` for this attribute, GEOSX will throw an error at the beginning of the simulation.

We also associate a **WellElementRegion** to each well. As the **CellElementRegion**,
it contains a ``materialList`` that must point (by name) to the constitutive models
defined in the **Constitutive** XML block.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/fluidFlow/benchmarks/Egg/dead_oil_egg.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_ELEMENT_REGIONS -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_ELEMENT_REGIONS_END -->


.. _Constitutive_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Defining material properties with constitutive laws
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The **CompositionalMultiphaseFlow** physics solver relies on at least three types of constitutive
models listed in the **Constitutive** XML block:

- a fluid model describing the thermodynamics behavior of the fluid mixture,
- a relative permeability model,
- a rock compressibility model.

All the parameters must be provided using the SI unit system.

Although the original Egg test case only involves two phases, the Dead-Oil model currently
implemented in GEOSX requires the definition of three phases (oil, gas, and water).
This is done in the **BlackOilFluid** XML block. The same is true for the relative permeability
model introduced in the **BrooksCoreyRelativePermeability** block.

.. note::
        The names and order of the phases listed for the attribute ``phaseNames`` must be identical in the fluid model and the relative permeability model.

The rock compressibility is defined in the
**PoreVolumeCompressibleSolid** block.
The parameters of these three blocks have been chosen to match the original specifications
of the Egg test case.

  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_CONSTITUTIVE_END -->


.. _FieldSpecifications_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Defining properties with the FieldSpecifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We are ready to specify the reservoir initial conditions of the problem in the **FieldSpecifications**
XML block.
The well variables do not have to be initialized here since they will be defined internally.

The formulation of the **CompositionalMultiphaseFlow** physics solver (documented
at :ref:`CompositionalMultiphaseFlow`) requires the definition of the initial pressure field
and initial global component fractions.
We define here a uniform pressure field that does not satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium,
but a hydrostatic initialization of the pressure field is possible using :ref:`FunctionManager`:.
For the initialization of the global component fractions, we remind the user that their ``component``
attribute (here, 0, 1, or 2) is used to point to a specific entry of the ``phaseNames`` attribute
in the **BlackOilFluid** block. 

Note that we also define the uniform porosity field here since it is not included in the mesh file
imported by the **PAMELAMeshGenerator**.

  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_FIELD_SPECS_END -->


.. _Outputs_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Specifying the output formats
----------------------------------

In this section, we request an output of the results in VTK format and an output of the rates for each producing well.
Note that the name defined here must match the name used in the **Events** XML block to define the output frequency.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/fluidFlow/benchmarks/Egg/dead_oil_egg.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_OUTPUT -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_TUT_DEAD_OIL_EGG_OUTPUT_END -->

.. _Tasks_tag_dead_oil_egg_model:

Specifying tasks
----------------------------------

In the **Events** block, we have defined four events requesting that a task periodically collects the rate for each producing well.
This task is defined here, in the **PackCollection** XML sub-block of the **Tasks** block.
The task contains the path to the object on which the field to collect is registered (here, a ``WellElementSubRegion``) and the name of the field (here, ``wellElementMixtureConnectionRate``).
The details of the history collection mechanism can be found in :ref:`TasksManager`.

A file compatible with Paraview is produced in this tutorial.
It is found in the output folder, and usually has the extension `.pvd`.
More details about this file format can be found 
`here <https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format>`_.
We can load this file into Paraview directly and visualize results:
