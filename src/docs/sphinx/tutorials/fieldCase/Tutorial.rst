Tutorial 3: A simple field case
#########################################

**Context**

In this tutorial, we set up a simple field case for single phase flow simulation (see :ref:`SinglePhaseFlow`).


**Objectives**

At the end of this tutorial you will know:

  - how to import external mesh information and properties,
  - how to run a specific solver (here, flow) in a specific region only,
  - the basic method of using boxes to set up boundary conditions,
  - how to control output frequency and export results for visualization.


**Input file**

The xml input file for this test case is located at:

.. code-block:: console

  src/coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml


*****************
Domain definition
*****************

We consider the following mesh as a numerical support to the simulations in this tutorial:

.. image:: mesh.png
   :width: 400px

This mesh contains three continuous regions:

  - a Top region (overburden, elementary tag = 1)
  - a Middle region (reservoir layer, elementary tag = 2)
  - a Bottom region (underburden, elementary tag = 3)


The mesh is defined using the GMSH file format (see :ref:`Meshes` for more information on
the supported mesh file format). Each tetrahedron is associated to a unique tag.

.. note::

  The GMSH file format starts numbering tags from 1. In GEOSX, the numbering
  of ``CellElementRegion`` starts from 0. As a consequence, when regions
  are defined in GEOSX, we substract 1 from the GMSH tag to refer
  to the same region. The next sections of this tutorial illustrates this.



***************************
Importing the mesh in GEOSX
***************************

Here, we use the ``PAMELAMeshGenerator`` to load the mesh (see :ref:`ImportingExternalMesh`).
The syntax to import external meshes is simple : in the XML file,
the mesh ``file`` is included with its path relative to the location of the input XML file
(or absolute)
and a user-specified ``name`` for the mesh object.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_MESH -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_MESH_END -->


************************
Running flow simulations
************************



We now run a single-phase flow simulations on this field.
We assume that the overburden and the underburden are impermeable,
and flow only happen in the reservoir.

There are two methods to achieve this regional solve.

The first solution is to define a unique ``CellElementRegion`` corresponding to the reservoir.

.. code-block:: xml

  <ElementRegion>
    <CellElementRegion name="ReservoirLayer"
                       cellBlocks="{1_TETRA}"
                       materialList="{water, rock}">
  </ElementRegion>

The second solution is to define all the ``CellElementRegions`` as they are in the GMSH file,
but defining the solvers only on the reservoir layer. In this case, the ``ElementRegion`` tag
is :

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_REGION -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_REGION_END -->

We choose the latest in order to keep the over- and underburden for visualization.

.. note::
  The material list here was set for a single phase flow problem. This list is subject
  to change if the problem is not a single phase flow problem.


Single Phase Flow, no well
==========================

Now, we demonstrate how to run a basic flow simulation in the reservoir layer.
We do not consider any coupling with wells. Injection and production will be specified by
imposing a high pressure in the cells close to the injection area and a low pressure
in the cells close to the production area.

Material definition
-------------------

We simulate a single phase flow in the reservoir layer with two types of materials, a fluid (water) and solid (rock).

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_CONSTITUTIVE -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_CONSTITUTIVE_END -->

The constitutive parameters such as the density, the viscosity, and the compressibility are specified in the International System of Units.

.. note::
  To consider an incompressible fluid, the user has to set the compressibility to 0.

Numerical methods
--------------------------

Once materials are defined, we define the numerical method used in the solver.
We use here a classical two-point flux approximation scheme.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_NUMERICAL -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_NUMERICAL_END -->

The ``TwoPointFluxApproximation`` node should specify
the primary field to solve for as ``fieldName``.
For a flow problem, this field is the pressure.


Solver settings
---------------

Let us inspect the ``Solver`` XML tags.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_SOLVER -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_SOLVER_END -->


This node gathers all the information previously defined.
We use a classical ``SinglePhaseFVM`` Finite Volume Method,
with the two-points flux approximation
defined in the ``NumericalMethod`` tag.
The ``targetRegions`` refers only
to the Reservoir region because we only solve for flow in this region.
The ``fluidNames`` and ``solidNames`` refer to the previously-defined materials
in the ``Constitutive`` tag.

The ``NonlinearSolverParameters`` and ``SystemSolverParameters`` are used to set
numerical solver parameters such as the Newton tolerance and the maximum number of
iterations.

Defining geometry boxes
-------------------------

The geometry boxes are useful in order to flag some cells or nodes within the mesh.
We use it here to lcoate the injection and production locations.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY_END -->

In order to define a box, the user defines ``xMax`` and ``xMin``, two opposite nodes of the box.


Field specification
-------------------

The next step is to specify fields, including:

  - The initial value (here, the pressure has to be initialized)
  - The static properties (here, we have to define the permeability tensor and the porosity)
  - The boundary conditions (here, the injection and production pressure have to be set)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_GEOMETRY_END -->

You may note :

 - All static parameters and initial value fields must have ``initialCondition`` field set to ``1``.
 - The ``objectPath`` refers to the ``ÃˆlementRegion`` in which the field has his value,
 - The ``setName`` field points to the box previously defined to apply the fields,
 - GEOSX handles permeability as a diagonal matrix, so the three values of the permeability tensor are set individually using the ``component`` field,
 - ``name`` and ``fieldName`` have a different meaning: ``name`` is used to give a name to the XML block. This ``name`` must be unique. ``fieldName`` is the name of the field register in GEOSX. This value has to be set according to the expected input fields of each solver.
 

Defining output
---------------

The ``Output`` XML tag is used to trigger the writing of visualization files.
Here, we write files in a format natively readable by Paraview.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_OUTPUT -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_OUTPUT_END -->

.. note::
  The ``name`` keyword defines the name of the output file.

Triggering events
-----------------

Last, we use events to guide the simulation through time,
and specify when outputs must to be  triggered.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../coreComponents/physicsSolvers/multiphysics/integratedTests/FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
  :language: xml
  :start-after: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_EVENTS -->
  :end-before: <!-- SPHINX_FIELD_CASE_EVENTS_END -->

The ``Events`` tag is associated with the ``maxTime`` keyword defining the maximum time.
If this time is ever reached or exceeded, the simulation ends.

Two ``PeriodicEvent`` are defined.
The first one is associated with the solver.
The  ``forceDt`` keyword means that there will always be time-steps of 20 seconds.
The second is associated with the output. The ``timeFrequency``
keyword means that it will be executed every 100 seconds. The ``targetExactTimestep`` is set to 1, meaning that
the Event Manager will impose this event will be triggered exactly every 100 seconds.

Launching the simulation
---------------------------

The simulation can be launched with:

.. code-block:: console

  geosx -i FieldCaseTutorial1.xml
