Git credentials
===============

It is also suggested that you setup SSH keys for authentication, and use SSH for your clones as discussed
`in this article <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.
Before going further, you should `test your ssh connection <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/testing-your-ssh-connection>`_. If it fails (perhaps because of your institution's proxy), you may consider the `personnal access token option <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>`_ as an alternative.
