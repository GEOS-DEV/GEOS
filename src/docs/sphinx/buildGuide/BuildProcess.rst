Building GEOSX
==============

Build steps
---------------------

- Create a host-config file that sets all system-specific CMake variables.
  Take a look at `host-config examples <https://github.com/GEOSX/GEOSX/blob/develop/host-configs>`_.
  We recommend the same host-config is used for both TPL and GEOSX builds.
  In particular, certain options (such as ``ENABLE_MPI`` or ``ENABLE_CUDA``) need to match between the two.

- Provide paths to all enabled TPLs.
  This can be done in one of two ways:

  * Provide each path via a separate CMake variable (see :ref:`Dependencies` for path variable names).
  * If you built TPLs from the ``tplMirror`` repository, you can set ``GEOSX_TPL_DIR`` variable in your host-config to point to the TPL installation path, and

    .. code-block:: cmake

       include("/path/to/GEOSX/host-configs/tpls.cmake")

    which will set all the individual TPL paths for you.

- Configure via ``config-build.py`` script:

  .. code-block:: console

     cd GEOSX
     python scripts/config-build.py --hostconfig=/path/to/host-config.cmake --buildtype=Release --installpath=/path/to/install/dir

  where

  * ``--buildpath`` or ``-bp`` is the build directory (by default, created under current working dir).
  * ``--installpath`` or ``-ip`` is the installation directory(wraps ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``).
  * ``--buildtype`` or ``-bt`` is a wrapper to the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` option.
  * ``--hostconfig`` or ``-hc`` is a path to host-config file.
  * all unrecognized options are passed to CMake.

- Run the build:

  .. code-block:: console

     cd <buildpath>
     make -j

You may also run the CMake configure step manually instead of relying on ``config-build.py``.
A full build typically takes between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on chosen compilers, options and number of cores.

Configuration options
---------------------

Below is a list of CMake configuration options, in addition to TPL options above.
Some options, when enabled, require additional settings (e.g. ``ENABLE_CUDA``).
Please see `host-config examples <https://github.com/GEOSX/GEOSX/blob/develop/host-configs>`_.
