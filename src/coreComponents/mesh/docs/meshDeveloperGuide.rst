Mesh Hierarchy
********************

In GEOSX, the mesh structure consists of a hierarchy of classes intended to encapsulate data and 
functionality for each topological type.
Each class in the mesh hierarchy represents a distinct topological object, such as a nodes, edges, 
faces, elements, etc.
The mesh data structure is illustrated in an object instantiation hierarchy.
The object instantiation hierarchy differs from a "class hierarchy" in that it shows 
how instantiations of each class relate to each other in the data hierarchy rather than how each class
type relates to each other in an inheritance diagram.

    Object Instantiation Hierarchy for the Mesh Objects.

To illustrate the mesh hierarchy, we propose to present it along with a model with two
regions (Top and Bottom) (:numref:`modelFig`).

   Example of a model with two regions

DomainPartition
===============   
In :numref:`MeshObjectInstantiationHierarchy` the top level object ``DomainPartition`` represents 
a partition of the decomposed physical domain.
At this time there is a unique ``DomainPartition`` for every MPI rank.
.. note::
  Hypothetically, 
  there may be more than one ``DomainPartition`` in cases where the ranks are overloaded.
  Currently GEOSX does not support overloading multiple ``DomainPartition``'s onto a rank, although
  this may be a future option if its use is properly motivated.

For instance, the model presented as example can be split into two different domains
(:numref:`domainPartFig`).

   Mesh partioned in two ``DomainPartition``

MeshBody
========
The ``MeshBody`` represents a topologically distinct mesh body.
For instance if a simulation of two separate spheres was required, then one option would be to have
both spheres as part of a single mesh body, while another option would be to have each sphere be 
a individual body.

.. note::
  While not currently utilized in GEOSX, the intent is to have the ability to handle the bodies
  in a multi-body mesh on an individual basis.
  For instance, when conducting high resolution crush simulations of granular materials (i.e. sand),
  it may be advantagous to represent each particle as a ``MeshBody``.

MeshLevel
=========
The ``MeshLevel`` is intended to facilitate the representation of a multi-level discretization of a ``MeshBody``.
.. note::
  In current practice, the code utilizes a single ``MeshLevel`` until such time as we 
  implement a proper multi-level mesh capability.
  The ``MeshLevel`` contains the main components that compose a discretized mesh in GEOSX.

Topological Mesh Objects
========================
Each of the "Manager" objects are responsible for holding child objects, data, and providing functionality
specific to a single topological object.
Each topological object that is used to define a discretized mesh has a "Manager" to allow for simple
traversal over the hierarchy, and to provide modular access to data.
As such, the ``NodeManager`` manages data for the "nodes", the ``EdgeManager`` manages data for the edges, the ``FaceManager`` holds data for the faces and the ``ElementRegionManager`` manages
the physical groups within the ``MeshLevel`` ( regions, fractures, wells etc...).
Additionally each manager contains index maps to the other types objects that are connected to the 
objects in that manager.
For instance, the ``FaceManager`` contains a downward pointing map that gives the nodes that comprise each
face in the mesh. 
Similarly the ``FaceManager`` contains an upward pointing map that gives the elements that are connected
to a face.

ElementRegionManager
--------------------
The element data structure is significantly more complicated than the other Managers.
While the other managers are "flat" across the ``MeshLevel``, the element data structure seeks to provide
a hierarchy in order to define groupings of the physical problem, as well as collecting discretization of 
similar topology.
At the top of the element branch of the hierarchy is the ``ElementRegionManager``.
The ``ElementRegionManager`` holds a collection of instantiations of ``ElementRegionBase`` derived
classes.

ElementRegion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conceptually the ``ElementRegion`` are used to defined regions of the problem domain where a 
``PhysicsSolver`` will be applied.

- The ``CellElementRegion`` is related to all the polyhedra
- The ``FaceElementRegion`` is related to all the faces that have physical meaning in the
  domain, such as fractures and faults. This object should not be mistaken with the
  ``FaceManager``. The ``FaceManager`` handles all the faces of the mesh, not only the
  faces of interest.
- The ``WellElementRegion`` is related to the well geometry.

An ``ElementRegion`` also has a list of materials allocated at each quadrature point across the entire 
region.
One example of the utility of the ``ElementRegion`` is the case of the simulation of the mechanics 
and flow within subsurface reservoir with an overburden.
We could choose to have two ``ElementRegion``, one being the reservoir, and one for the 
overburden. 
The mechanics solver would be applied to the entire problem, while the flow problem would be applied only 
to the reservoir region.

Each ``ElementRegion`` holds some number of ``ElementSubRegion``. 
The ``ElementSubRegion`` is meant to hold all the element topologies present in an ``ElementSubRegion`` 
in their own groups. 
For instance, for a ``CellElementRegion``, there may be one ``CellElementSubRegion`` for all
tetrahedra, one for all hexahedra, one for all wedges and one for all the pyramids (:fig:`meshPolyFig`).

   Model meshed with different cell types

Now that all the classes of the mesh hierarchy has been described, we propose to adapt the diagram
presented in :fig:`diagFig` to match with the example presented in :numref:`modelFig`.
