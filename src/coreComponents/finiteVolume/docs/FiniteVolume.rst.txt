Finite Volume Discretization
---------------------------------

Two different finite-volume discretizations are available to simulate single-phase flow in GEOSX, namely, a standard cell-centered TPFA approach, and a hybrid finite-volume scheme relying on both cell-centered and face-centered degrees of freedom.
The key difference between these two approaches is the computation of the flux, as detailed below.

Standard cell-centered TPFA FVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the standard scheme implemented in the `SinglePhaseFVM` flow solver.
It only uses cell-centered degrees of freedom and implements a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) for the computation of the flux.
The numerical flux is obtained using the following expression for the mass flux between cells :math:`K` and :math:`L`:

.. math::
  F_{KL} = \Upsilon_{KL} \frac{\rho^{upw}}{\mu^{upw}} \big( p_K - p_L - \rho^{avg} g ( d_K - d_L ) \big),

where :math:`p_K` is the pressure of cell :math:`K`, :math:`d_K` is the depth of cell :math:`K`, and :math:`\Upsilon_{KL}` is the standard TPFA transmissibility coefficient at the interface.
The fluid density, :math:`\rho^{upw}`, and the fluid viscosity, :math:`\mu^{upw}`, are upwinded using the sign of the potential difference at the interface. 

This is currently the only available discretization in the :ref:`CompositionalMultiphaseFlow`. 

Hybrid FVM
~~~~~~~~~~

This discretization scheme overcomes the limitations of the standard TPFA on non K-orthogonal meshes.
The hybrid finite-volume scheme--equivalent to the well-known hybrid Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD) scheme--remains consistent with the pressure equation even when the mesh does not satisfy the K-orthogonality condition.
This numerical scheme is currently implemented in the `SinglePhaseHybridFVM` solver.

The hybrid FVM scheme uses both cell-centered and face-centered pressure degrees of freedom.
The one-sided face flux, :math:`F_{K,f}`, at face :math:`f` of cell :math:`K` is computed as:

.. math::
  F_{K,f} = \frac{\rho^{upw}}{\mu^{upw}} \widetilde{F}_{K,f},

where :math:`\widetilde{F}_{K,f}` reads:

.. math::
  \widetilde{F}_{K,f} = \sum_{f'} \Upsilon_{ff'} \big( p_K - \pi_f - \rho_K g ( d_K - d_f ) \big).

In the previous equation, :math:`p_K` is the cell-centered pressure, :math:`\pi_f` is the face-centered pressure, :math:`d_K` is the depth of cell :math:`K`, and :math:`d_f` is the depth of face :math:`f`.
The fluid density, :math:`\rho^{upw}`, and the fluid viscosity, :math:`\mu^{upw}`, are upwinded using the sign of :math:`\widetilde{F}_{K,f}`. 
The local transmissibility :math:`\Upsilon` of size :math:`n_{\textit{local faces}} \times n_{\textit{local faces}}` satisfies:

.. math::
  N K = \Upsilon C    

Above, :math:`N` is a matrix of size :math:`n_{\textit{local faces}} \times 3` storing the normal vectors to each face in this cell, :math:`C` is a matrix of size :math:`n_{\textit{local faces}} \times 3` storing the vectors from the cell center to the face centers, and :math:`K` is the permeability tensor.  
The local transmissibility matrix, :math:`\Upsilon`, is currently  computed using the quasi-TPFA approach described in Chapter 6 of this `book <https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108591416>`_.
The scheme reduces to the TPFA discretization on K-orthogonal meshes but remains consistent when the mesh does not satisfy this property.
The mass flux :math:`F_{K,f}` written above is then added to the mass conservation equation of cell :math:`K`. 

In addition to the mass conservation equations, the hybrid FVM involves algebraic constraints at each mesh face to enforce mass conservation.
For a given interior face :math:`f` between two neighboring cells :math:`K` and :math:`L`, the algebraic constraint reads:

.. math::
  \widetilde{F}_{K,f} + \widetilde{F}_{L,f} = 0.

We obtain a numerical scheme with :math:`n_{\textit{cells}}` cell-centered degrees of freedom and :math:`n_{\textit{faces}}` face-centered pressure degrees of freedom.
The system involves :math:`n_{\textit{cells}}` mass conservation equations and :math:`n_{\textit{faces}}` face-based constraints.
The linear systems can be efficiently solved using the MultiGrid Reduction (MGR) preconditioner implemented in the Hypre linear algebra package.  

The implementation of the hybrid FVM scheme for :ref:`CompositionalMultiphaseFlow` is in progress.
