 * @brief Wrapper class for umpire allocator, only used to determine which umpire allocator to use based on

 *       are also singletons. It currently isn't mostly because we use the default constructor in the buffer_type
 *       instantiations in the neighbor comm (which can be refactored to use a singleton instance-getter fairly easily).
 *       In general though it would mean any trivial usage of the buffer_type this is used in more cumbersome.
 *       At the moment our usage looks like:
 *         buffer_type(size)
 *       but if this was a singleton it would necessitate that we create buffers as: (outside of neighbor comm)
 *         buffer_type(size,BufferAllocator<buffer_type>::getInstance())
 *       which is messy. Changing the buffer_type can fix the issue but would introduce additional refactoring so for
 *       the moment this implementation suffices.
