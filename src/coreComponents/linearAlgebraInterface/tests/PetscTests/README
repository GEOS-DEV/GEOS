In this directory:

classes:
  PetscVector
  PetscSparseMatrix
  PetscSolver 

test file:
  makefile
  testLAOperations.cpp
  
These are wrappers around PETSc objects to be used with GEOSX (in progress). 
They are functional and working properly, but use int/double types (not what GEOSX wants).

Yay!
