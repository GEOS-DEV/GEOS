Parallel Partitioning
###############################################################################

Parallel GEOSX simulations involves multiple ``partitions`` and there are ``ghost`` objects in each partition. 
Users need to understand these concepts to effectively design models and visualize results.

Partitions
========================

A model, or more strictly, a computational domain, is stored in a distributed fashion among many processors. 
In the following simple example, the computational domain has 10 elements and the simulation involves two processors.
The first processor, "partition 0" ("0" is called the "rank" of the processor) owns the first five elements (0 to 4) while "partition 1" owns 5 to 9. 
When the whole domain is divided into partitions, each partition will number the elements and other objects such as nodes, faces, and edges in the partition . 
Therefore, in both partitions, the element IDs start from zero. 
Element 0 in partition 1 is element 5 (or the sixth element) of the original domain. 
In parallel computing, each partition does not only need to know information about its own elements, 
but it also needs to know information about some elements owned by the neighbor partitions if these elements are directly connected to objects in this partition. 
For example, elements 0 in partition 1 (i.e. element 5 in the original whole domain) is connected to element 4 in partition 0. 
Therefore, partition 0 will keep a copy of this element (including the data associated with this element) which is synchronized with the corresponding information in the partition that actually owns this element. 
In summary, a partition owns a number of elements and other objects (e.g. faces) and also keeps copies of objects from neighbor partitions. 
Partitioning is automatically handled by GEOSX once the user specifies how the domain should be divided.

The following figure show the partitioning of a simple mesh. 
Real nodes appear as solid red circles in the owning partition and ghost nodes are shown as hollow circles.

Specifying partitioning pattern
=================================

Cartesian partitioning
-----------------------
In the command line to run GEOSX, the user can specify the partitioning pattern by adding the following switches:
(placeholder)

Graph-based partitioning
---------------------------


Ghost ranks
===============
Each object (node, edge, face, or element) has a ``ghost rank`` attribute, stored in the ``ghostRank`` field. 
If a object does not appear in any other partition as a ghost, its ghost rank is a large negative number, -2.14e9 in a typical system.
If a object is real (owned by the current partition) but exists in other partitions as ghosts, its ghost rank is -1.
The ghost rank of a ghost object is the rank of the partition that owns the corresponding real object.

Considerations for visualization
=================================
In VisIt, a partition is called a ``domain``. 
The ID of a domain is the rank of the corresponding partition in GEOSX plus one.
VisIt would display all elements/objects regardless if they are real or ghosts.
As information about a ghost is synchronized with the real object, VisIt just overlaying the same images on top of each other.
The user would not perceive the overlapping between partitions unless the models are shown as semi-transparent entities.
Note that if ghosts are not hidden, results from a ``query`` operation, such as summation of variable values, would be wrong due to double-counting.
Therefore, it is a good practice or habit to hide ghost objects using ghostRank as a filter. 

If the visualization method involves interpolation, such as interpolating a zonal field into a nodal field or generating contours, 
the interpretation near partition boundaries is not accurate.
