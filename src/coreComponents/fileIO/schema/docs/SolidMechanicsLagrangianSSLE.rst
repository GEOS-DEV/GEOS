verboseLevel           integer      0        Verbosity level for this solver. Higher values will lead to more screen output. For non-debug  simulations, this should remain at 0.                                                                                                                                                                                    
cflFactor              real64       0.5      Factor to apply to the `CFL condition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy_condition>`_ when calculating the maximum allowable time step. Values should be in the interval (0,1]                                                                                                                       
discretization         string       none     Name of discretization object (defined in the :ref:`NumericalMethodsManager`) to use for this solver. For instance, if this is a Finite Element Solver, the name of a :ref:`FiniteElement` should be specified. If this is a Finite Volume Method, the name of a :ref:`FiniteVolume` discretization should bespecified. 
targetRegions          string_array required Allowable regions that the solver may be applied to. Note that this does not indicate that the solver will be applied to these regions, only that allocation will occur such that the solver may be applied to these regions. The decision about what regions this solver will beapplied to rests in the EventManager.
