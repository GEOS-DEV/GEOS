Compositional multiphase fluid model
############################################

Overview
=========================

This model represents a full composition description of a multiphase multicomponent fluid.
Phase behavior is modeled by an Equation of State (EOS) and partitioning of components into
phases is computed based on instantaneous chemical equilibrium via a two- or three-phase flash.
Each component (species) is characterized by molar weight and critical properties that
serve as input parameters for the EOS.
See `Petrowiki`_ for more information.

Usage
=========================

The model represented by ``<CompositionalMultiphaseFluid>`` node in the input.
Under the hood this is a wrapper around ``PVTPackage`` library, which is included as a submodule.
In order to use the model, GEOSX must be built with ``-DENABLE_PVTPACKAGE=ON`` (default).

The following attributes are supported:
