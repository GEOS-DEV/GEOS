# Triggers Conduit pipeline asking for uberenv update
# UPDATE_UBERENV variable, when set, will tell conduit to use the value as
# a reference to the uberenv env revision to checkout on github.

# Note: the following pipelines have been disabled because
# - they need to be fixed
# - they cause quota issues (conduit CI is quite space consuming)
# - they may cause too much trafic in projects pipeline views
