To use this you will need to have a working copy of GEOSX.  

***Running***
(1) Modify/create an input file named "pfw_input_fileName.py", where "fileName" 
is whatever you want it to be.

(2) Create a copy of runClean_template.sh (e.g. runClean_fileName.sh)
	- change inputFile on line 5
	- change pathToGEOS on line 7 if particleFileWriter.py and GEOS_ROOT do not
	share a parent directory
	- change userBank on line 9
	- change runLocation on line 14 if desired

(3) Launch ./runClean_fileName.sh from it's containing directory.

You will see some text splash as it creates the input files and it will 
indicate the number of particles created. 

change to the runLocation directory to see the created files.

***Post processing***

GEOS-MPM writes .vtu and .vtp files at a frequency specified within the input
file, pft_input_fileName.py.
This data can be visualized in Paraview.
