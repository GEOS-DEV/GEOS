# FILE ....... parseRstNarrative.py

# PURPOSE .... This script parses a .cpp file and creates an .rst file in a
#              narrative format. Code comments in the .cpp become standard text,
#              while actual code becomes a verbatim block in the rst. The target
#              use case is to transform a unit or integrated test into a quick user
#              tutorial by adding longer comments in the implementation.

# CREATED .... Sep 2018
