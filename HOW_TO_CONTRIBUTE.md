How is the GEOS project organized
=================================

The **Architecture Committee** oversees significant changes to the GEOS architecture, ensuring compliance with organizational standards and security measures. Developers must present their ideas to the committee for initial approval before opening a Pull Request (PR), with the committee aiming to provide decisions within a week. The committee meets bi-weekly and on-demand, including representatives from each entity and relevant stakeholders.

The **Operations Committee** handles the day-to-day management of the project, including managing pull requests (PRs), resolving tickets/issues, and assigning tasks. This committee ensures smooth development workflows and aligns daily operations with project goals.

Tools:
- Everything currently happens on GitHub.
- New tools will be evaluated depending on the needs.
