How to contribute to the GEOS project
-------------------------------------

Architecture committee
- Prior to opening a PR, a developer should present the idea to the Committee
    - Go/No go decisions in reasonable time (1 week)
- Any development which significantly modifies the architecture of GEOS must be validated by the committee before merging
    - with review
        - Logs
        - Ghosting
        - add/remove TPL dependency
        - High-order methods / shiva
    - without review
        - Bugfixes
        - documentation
        - numerical methods tuning
- bi-weekly + on-demand (it’s the developer’s duty to ask for a slot on the #dev-infrastructure slack channel)
- who:
    - 1 person of each entity + every person which skillset matches (+/- product owner of components).
    - Everybody’s welcome to attend.

Every day management.
- Pull request management
    - Reviewer selection confirmation for all the developments that went through the Architecture committee.
        - Make sure the owner/s of the impacted components of GEOS are included
        - Ensure a mix of junior and senior developers is involved in each PR
    - Track progress
- Issue (ticket) management
    - Triaging by the committee
        - Meeting frequency (weekly to take care of the current backlog, later possibly less frequent)
    - Track progress
- Assignments
    - Each entity can assign tasks to their people.
    - If resource needs to hop from one entity to another, collegial discussion will happen during this meeting
- Every week.

Tools
- Everything currently happens on GitHub.
- New tools will be evaluated depending on the needs.
