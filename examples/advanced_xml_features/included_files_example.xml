  <!--
Note: This example uses the advanced xml input features,
           and needs to be compiled using pygeos.

These following files will be recursively added to the current xml structure
using the following rules:

  For each included file:
    Merge all attributes at the current level
    Continue merging objects at the next level if:
      At the root level and an object with the matching tag exists
      The “name” attribute is present and a object with the matching tag and name exist
      Any preexisting attributes are overwritten by the donor
    Otherwise insert the target into the xml structure as-is

  <Included>

    <File
